## Prompt

Create: repository setup plan, Docusaurus architecture overview, detailed content hierarchy and section structure, subagent/skill inventory and creation roadmap, phased development workflow, quality assurance checkpoints, deployment pipeline.
Project phases (sequential with allowed overlap):

Phase 1: Repository initialization and environment setup
Phase 2: Creation and registration of Claude Code subagents and skills
Phase 3: Docusaurus project bootstrapping and TypeScript configuration
Phase 4: Content organization and Markdown file creation (module by module)
Phase 5: Full integration of all provided course content with consistent formatting
Phase 6: Sidebar navigation refinement and site theming
Phase 7: Local build testing and GitHub Pages deployment
Phase 8: Final review against success criteria and bonus assessment

Docusaurus site architecture sketch:

Static site generated by Docusaurus v3 (latest stable)
TypeScript enabled for all custom components/plugins (strict mode)
Standard folder structure: /docs for Markdown content, /src for custom TS/TSX pages/components, /static for assets
Python backend preparation: create /backend directory with FastAPI skeleton (no running server required in Part 1)
Context7 MCP server used exclusively during development: Claude Code invokes build-time API calls to fetch current documentation for Docusaurus, ROS 2, NVIDIA Isaac, etc., ensuring accuracy in examples and explanations

Content section structure (sidebar hierarchy):

Landing Page (/)
→ Course Overview (Focus & Theme, Goal, Quarter Overview)
→ Why Physical AI Matters
→ Learning Outcomes
Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
→ ROS 2 Fundamentals (Weeks 3–5 content)
Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
→ Simulation with Gazebo & Unity (Weeks 6–7 content)
Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)
→ NVIDIA Isaac Platform (Weeks 8–10 content)
Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
→ Humanoid Robot Development (Weeks 11–12)
→ Conversational Robotics (Week 13)
→ Capstone Project
Additional Pages
→ Weekly Breakdown Summary
→ Assessments
→ Hardware Requirements (full section with all subsections, options, tables, and Economy Jetson Kit)

Subagent and skill creation roadmap:

Minimum 4 subagents (.claude/agents/*.md with YAML frontmatter):
→ ROS2Agent – specializes in ROS 2 concepts, URDF, rclpy bridging
→ SimulationAgent – handles Gazebo, Unity, sensor simulation
→ IsaacAgent – covers NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, perception
→ VLAAgent – manages VLA, voice-to-action, LLM integration, capstone
Minimum 3 reusable skills (.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md):
→ MarkdownMasterSkill – enforces consistent headings, lists, code blocks, table formatting
→ TableGeneratorSkill – creates responsive Markdown tables (especially hardware specs)
→ SidebarBuilderSkill – assists in generating and validating docusaurus sidebar configuration
Subagents and skills invoked concurrently during content writing phases to draft, refine, and validate sections

Development workflow:

Follow Spec-Kit Plus cycle: specify → clarify → plan → implement (current phase: plan)
All content generation assisted by Claude Code with Context7 fetches for up-to-date docs
Commit early and often with descriptive messages (e.g., "feat: add Module 1 ROS2Agent", "content: draft Hardware Requirements tables")
Use main branch for development; deployment from built static files via GitHub Pages

Deployment pipeline:

Configure docusaurus.config.js with correct projectName, organizationName, baseUrl for GitHub Pages
Run npm run build locally and serve with npm run serve for verification
Push to GitHub repository
Enable GitHub Pages (source: / (root) or /docs depending on build output)
Confirm live URL loads correctly with full navigation

Quality validation and testing strategy (tied directly to success criteria):

Content completeness: checklist confirming every item from provided course details is present and accurately represented (no additions or omissions)
Formatting consistency: all headings, tables, code blocks follow uniform style (validated via skills)
Navigation integrity: sidebar reflects exact hierarchy above; all internal links functional
Subagent/skill evidence: .claude directories populated and commit history shows usage
Build and deployment: zero errors on npm run build; deployed site matches local build
Responsiveness check: site usable on desktop and mobile widths
Bonus readiness: evaluate subagent/skill design for reusability, clarity, and effectiveness (higher quality yields higher bonus points)

Technical details:

Concurrent approach encouraged: begin content drafting for early modules while finalizing later subagents
TypeScript for all custom frontend code; Python 3.11+ structure prepared for future backend
No runtime dynamic features implemented in this part (static site only)
Phases may overlap (e.g., Phase 4 content work starts while Phase 2 subagents are still being refined)

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive implementation plan for Docusaurus book feature. Generated plan.md with technical context and constitution check, research.md with technology decisions, data-model.md with content entities, quickstart.md with setup instructions, and contracts/content-api.yaml for future functionality. Plan addresses all 8 development phases, implements proper architecture with TypeScript, Docusaurus v3, and Claude Code agents/skills. Ready for implementation phase.

## Outcome
- ✅ Impact: Complete implementation plan with all required artifacts created
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, and contracts created
- 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed to /sp.tasks for task breakdown and implementation
- 🧠 Reflection: Plan aligns with all requirements and constitution principles

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
- Failure modes observed: PowerShell scripts not available on system, manual process required
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Automate planning process when PowerShell available
