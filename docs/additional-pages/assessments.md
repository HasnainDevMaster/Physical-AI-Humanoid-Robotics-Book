# Assessments

## Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course

This page outlines the assessment structure for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. Assessments are designed to evaluate your understanding of both theoretical concepts and practical applications.

## Assessment Structure

### Module Assessments (60% of final grade)
Each module includes both theoretical and practical assessments:

1. **Module 1 Assessment**: ROS2 Fundamentals
   - Theoretical Quiz: Basic ROS2 concepts, architecture, and communication patterns
   - Practical Exercise: Creating a ROS2 package with custom messages and services

2. **Module 2 Assessment**: Simulation with Gazebo & Unity
   - Theoretical Quiz: Simulation principles, physics engines, and sensor modeling
   - Practical Exercise: Creating a simulation environment with robot and sensors

3. **Module 3 Assessment**: NVIDIA Isaac Platform
   - Theoretical Quiz: Isaac platform components, GPU acceleration, and AI integration
   - Practical Exercise: Implementing an Isaac-based robot application

4. **Module 4 Assessment**: Humanoid Robot Development
   - Theoretical Quiz: Humanoid kinematics, walking algorithms, and control systems
   - Practical Exercise: Developing a basic humanoid robot controller

### Final Project (40% of final grade)
The final project integrates all course concepts into a comprehensive humanoid robot application that demonstrates proficiency in all modules.

## Learning Objectives Assessment

Each assessment is aligned with the module's learning objectives:

- **Knowledge**: Understanding of fundamental concepts and principles
- **Application**: Ability to apply concepts in practical scenarios
